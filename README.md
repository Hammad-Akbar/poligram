# Poligram

Poligram aims to deliver a politically inspiring app accessible from the browser. 
Poligram will provide an interactive way to learn about politics and politicians in America. 
Poligram will feature a way to search for politicians and learn about their views on topics, take meaningful quizzes to test your knowledge, and keep up with current issues in the news.

## Motivation

We've seen some political websites that quiz you on different things about politics, however, as some people donâ€™t know much about politics and at this time especially with elections coming up, we wanted to make an application to provide people with the knowledge of some important political figures, news about them, and quiz them on one single application. 

#### Heroku Link

``https://poligram.herokuapp.com``

## Setup:

### Setting Up Heroku:

0. Sign up for heroku at heroku.com 
1. Install heroku by running `npm install -g heroku`
2. Go through the following steps:
    ```
    heroku login -i
    heroku create
    git push heroku master
    ```
3. Navigate to your newly-created heroku site!
      
4. Configure requirements.txt with all requirements needed to run your app.
    These requirements are all the packages needed to run your program:
      ```
      pip freeze > requirements.txt
      ```
5. Configure Procfile with the command needed to run your app.
      ```
      web: python app.py
      ```
6. When you are ready to deploy your app, first push your changes to git using `git push`. Then run `git push heroku master` to deploy your app to heroku. If that does not work, try using the command, `git push heroku HEAD:master`.

7. If you are still having issues, you may use `heroku logs --tail` to see what's wrong.

### Setting up React     
1. Install your stuff! 
```
npm install
pip install flask-socketio 
pip install eventlet 
npm install -g webpack   
npm install --save-dev webpack
npm install socket.io-client --save   
npm install --save react-router-dom
npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
npm install react-google-login
npm install @material-ui/core
npm install @material-ui/lab
npm install --save sweetalert2
npm i react-usa-map
```

:warning: :warning: :warning: If you see any error messages, make sure you use `sudo pip` or `sudo npm`. If it says "pip cannot be found", run `which pip` and use `sudo [path to pip from which pip] install` :warning: :warning: :warning:    
  
### Getting PSQL to work with Python  
  
1. Update yum: `sudo yum update`, and enter yes to all prompts    
2. Upgrade pip: `sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install --upgrade pip`  
3. Get psycopg2: `sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install psycopg2-binary`    
4. Get SQLAlchemy: `sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.1`    
  
### Setting up PSQL  
  
1. Install PostGreSQL: `sudo yum install postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-devel postgresql-contrib postgresql-docs`    
    Enter yes to all prompts.    
2. Initialize PSQL database: `sudo service postgresql initdb`    
3. Start PSQL: `sudo service postgresql start`    
4. Make a new superuser: `sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER`    
    :warning: :warning: :warning: If you get an error saying "could not change directory", that's okay! It worked! :warning: :warning: :warning:    
5. Make a new database: `sudo -u postgres createdb $USER`    
        :warning: :warning: :warning: If you get an error saying "could not change directory", that's okay! It worked! :warning: :warning: :warning:    
6. Make sure your user shows up:    
    a) `psql`    
    b) `\du` look for ec2-user as a user    
    c) `\l` look for ec2-user as a database    
7. Make a new user:    
    a) `psql` (if you already quit out of psql)    
    #### REPLACE THE [VALUES] IN THIS COMMAND! Type this with a new (short) unique password.   
    b) I recommend 4-5 characters - it doesn't have to be very secure. Remember this password!  
        `create user [some_username_here] superuser password '[some_unique_new_password_here]';`    
    c) `\q` to quit out of sql    
8. Make a new file called `sql.env` and add `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/postgres` in it, where user and pass are the username and password you created in 7b. 
  
### Enabling read/write from SQLAlchemy  
There's a special file that you need to enable your db admin password to work for:  
1. Open the file in vim: `sudo vim /var/lib/pgsql9/data/pg_hba.conf`
If that doesn't work: `sudo vim $(psql -c "show hba_file;" | grep pg_hba.conf)`  
2. Replace all values of `ident` with `md5` in Vim: `:%s/ident/md5/g`  
3. After changing those lines, run `sudo service postgresql restart`  
4. Ensure that `sql.env` has the username/password of the superuser you created!  

### Claim your API Keys
1. Go to `https://newsapi.org/` and Sign up!
2. Go to `https://dictionaryapi.com` and Sign up!
3. Create a file .env in your root directory, Copy `NEWS_API_KEY='YOUR API KEYS'`  and `DICT_API_KEY='YOUR API KEY` and save it to .env.

### Run your code!    
1. `npm run watch`. If prompted to install webpack-cli, type "yes"    
2. Go into the python interactive shell and run the following:  
    a) `import models`  
    b) `models.db.create_all()`     
    c) `quit()` 
3. In a new terminal, `sudo service postgresql start` to start PSQL
4. `source news.env`
5. `python app.py`    
6. Preview Running Application (might have to clear your cache by doing a hard refresh)    

### Pushing to Heroku
After you create your heroku app, you will need to push the database to heroku:
1. Create a database on heroku `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev`
2. Wait until ready to use `heroku pg:wait`
3. Alter the database owner:    
    a) `psql`   
    b) `ALTER DATABASE Postgres OWNER TO user` [where user is the username created in Section: "Setting up PSQL", 7b]   
4. Now push the database onto heroku, `heroku pg:push postgres DATABASE_URL`

### Unit Testing
1. In order to run unit tests source any .env files you have, `coverage run -m --source=. unittest tests/*.py`
2. To see coverage report, preview the file `index.html` in the `htmlcov` folder.
3. When making changes, need to rerun, `coverage run -m --source=. unittest tests/*.py && coverage html`

### Linting
Install the dependencies!
```
pip install pylint-flask
pip install pylint_flask_sqlalchemy
```
1. For any python file run the command, `pylint fileName.py` where fileName is the name of the python file.
2. For models.py, run this command, `pylint --load-plugins pylint_flask_sqlalchemy models.py`

### Technical Issues Faced in this project
1. After using one autocomplete library for React, we had issues with styling the searchbar, so we had to research
more and use another autocomplete library to do the feature.
2. We had some issues with feedback section, like the limit of feedback was suppose to be 1000 characters,
and had some issues doing that.
3. Also, had some minor issues with styling the News page.
4. There were some issues with tests in CircleCI.

### Solving those issues
1. After researching, we used material-ui custom component to make the autocomplete feature work, and used
custom props to style the component. 
2. After researching, we used state to check the character count, and showed the user error when the character count 
has reached, and we made sure user can't store that feedback in the database unless he reduces the character count.
3. We came together as a group and gave ideas how to solve the issue because the news card was covering the
searchbar, so we gave our ideas, decided which is the best method to solve the issue, and we were able to fix the 
styling error for the News section.
4. After looking at the error reports, we realized that the issue seemed to be due to a database connection problem. This made sense, since CircleCI didn't have a local database like we did. We considered setting up a Docker image with a database, but ultimately settled on simply mocking out all database calls in the tests themselves.

### Issues still exist in the app
1. Our app is heavily reliant on APIs, so if in the future they stop working it could make some features
of our app not that useful.

### If we had more time
1. Create the politician search page and include an interactive map to search for politicians [would need to build our own API]
2. Create public polls
3. OAuth login with Facebook
